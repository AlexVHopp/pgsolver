%\section{Benchmark Games}

The \pgsolver library contains a few programs that create benchmarks for the parity game
solvers. They are built using the command
\begin{verbatim}
    ~/pgsolver> make generators
\end{verbatim}
and reside afterwards in the subdirectory \texttt{bin}.

Additionally, it is possible to compile all generators directly into \pgsolver by setting
the variable \texttt{LINKGENERATORS} to \texttt{YES} in the \texttt{./Config}-file. This
has the advantage that the process of generating and solving a game is not slowed down by
formatting the game first and parsing it afterwards again into the same data structure.

\section{Random Games}

Randomly generated parity games are the simplest form of benchmarking utility to assess the
performance of game solvers. The ones used here are parametrized by four parameters: the number
$n$ of nodes in the game, the highest priority $p$, a lower and an upper bound $l$ and $u$ on the
out-degree of each node. The call
\begin{verbatim}
    ~/pgsolver> bin/randomgame 1000 200 2 5
\end{verbatim}
creates a random game with 1000 nodes as follows: for each node $v$,
\begin{itemize}
\item the priority $\Omega(v)$ is uniformly chosen among $\{0,\ldots,200\}$;
\item node $v$ belongs to player $0$ with probability $0.5$ and therefore to player $1$ with
      probability $0.5$ as well;
\item a number $d$ is uniformly chosen in the range $\{2,\ldots,5\}$, and $d$ pairwise different
      nodes are uniformly chosen as $v$'s successors.
\end{itemize}
Beware that \texttt{bin/randomgame} may crash or not terminate if the lower bound on the outdegree
is greater than the upper bound or that one is greater than the number of nodes.


\section{Clustered Random Games}

Almost every game created by the random generator above consists of a single big SCC and many adhesive
chains.

Therefore this generator uses an other random model that accomplishes to bring a bit more structure into its instances. It depends on nine parameters: The number of nodes $n$, the highest possibly occurring priority $p$, an out-degree range $(l;h)$, a recursion depth $r$, a recursion breadth range $(a;b)$ and an interconnection range $(x;y)$. An instance of $\mathcal{G}^c_{(n,r)}$ with $c = (p,l,h,a,b,x,y)$ can be generated as follows. If $r = 0$ or $a > n$ simply return a randomly generated game with $n$ nodes, highest priority $p$ and out-degree bounds $l$ and $h$ as above. If $r > 0$ and $a \leq n$,
\begin{itemize}
\item a number $d$ is uniformly chosen in the range $\{a,\ldots,\min(b,n)\}$;
\item $d$ numbers $k_0,\ldots,k_{d-1}$ are uniformly chosen in the range $\{0,\ldots,n-1\}$ s.t.\ $\sum_{i=0}^{d-1} k_i = n$;
\item $d$ instances $G_0,\ldots,G_{d-1}$ are chosen, where $G_i$ is chosen from $\mathcal{G}^c_{(k_i,r-1)}$ (we assume the nodes of all $G_i$ to be pairwise different);
\item a game $G$ is created by the union of all $G_i$;
\item a number $e$ is uniformly chosen in the range $\{x,\ldots,y\}$;
\item $e$ additional uniformly chosen edges in $G$ are added to $G$;
\item the game $G$ is returned.
\end{itemize}

Basically, this recursive approach creates a topological tree structure that is partially intercepted by adding the additional interconnection edges.

A clustered random game with 1000 nodes, highest priority 2, out-degree bounds 2 and 5, recursion depth 3, recursion breadth between 4 and 6 and interconnection degree between 11 and 22 is created using the call
\begin{verbatim}
    ~/pgsolver> bin/clusteredrandomgame 1000 200 2 5 3 4 6 11 22
\end{verbatim}


\section{Steady Random Games}

The Steady Random Generator tries to circumvent many universal optimisations in order to particularly
benchmark the backend solvers. The Steady Random Generator is parametrized by five parameters: the number
$n$ of nodes (and different priorities) in the game, a lower and an upper bound and on the
out-degree of each node and a lower and an upper bound and on the in-degree of each node. The call
\begin{verbatim}
    ~/pgsolver> bin/steadygame 1000 2 4 3 5
\end{verbatim}
creates a random game with 1000 nodes as follows: for each node $v$,
\begin{itemize}
\item the priority $\Omega(v)$ is simply $v$;
\item node $v$ belongs to player $0$ with probability $0.5$ and therefore to player $1$ with
      probability $0.5$ as well;
\item a number $d$ is uniformly chosen in the range $\{2,\ldots,4\}$, and $d$ pairwise different
      nodes are uniformly chosen in $v$'s subgame as $v$'s successors;
\item a number $d$ is uniformly chosen in the range $\{3,\ldots,5\}$, and an attempt is made to ensure
      that $v$ has $d$ pairwise different predecessors.
\end{itemize}
All edges are iteratively determined as long as there are at least two different nodes with one of them violating
a lower bound and the other one being below the opposite upper bound uniformly between two such nodes.


\section{Clique Games}

The clique game of order $n$ is $G_n = (\{0,\ldots,n-1\},\{0,2,4,\ldots\},\{1,3,5,\ldots\},E,\Omega)$
with $E = \{ (v,w) \mid v \ne w \}$ and $\Omega(v) = v$. It forms a clique in a directed graph without
self-cycles. Clique games exhibit a large amount of cycles in the game which may pose difficulties
for certain solvers. Note that adding self-cycles to the nodes will result in easy solving because
self-cycles are partial winning strategies in this case, and then all other nodes would lie in the attractor
of these winning regions.

The clique game of order $50$ for instance is generated as follows.
\begin{verbatim}
    ~/pgsolver> bin/cliquegame 50
\end{verbatim}
The clique game of order 50 with self-cycles can also be generated.
\begin{verbatim}
    ~/pgsolver> bin/cliquegame 50 self
\end{verbatim}


\section{Ladder Games}
\label{sec:laddergame}

The name of these games is derived from their structure which is reminiscent of a ladder. The
\emph{ladder game} of index $n$ is $G_n = (V,V_0,V_1,E,\Omega)$, defined as follows.
\begin{itemize}
\item $V = \{0,\ldots,2n-1\}$,
\item $V_0 = \{0,2,4,\ldots,2n-2\}$, $V_1 = \{1,3,5,\ldots,2n-1\}$,
\item $E = \{ (v,w) \mid w \equiv_{2n} v+i $ for some $i \in \{1,2\}$ $\}$,
\item $\Omega(v) = v \mod 2$.
\end{itemize}
where $\equiv_{2n}$ means equality modulo $2n$.

It is not hard to see that player $0$ wins on $V_0$ and player $1$ wins on $V_1$ since both can
stay within these regions and only see the priorities $0$, resp.\ $1$.

Ladder games are chosen as benchmarks because in $G_n$ there are $2^n$ many positional strategies for each
player but only one of them is a winning strategy. Not surprisingly, ladder games are very difficult
to solve for the strategy guessing heuristic for example.

The ladder game of index 19 is created using the call
\begin{verbatim}
    ~/pgsolver> bin/laddergame 19
\end{verbatim}



\section{Jurdzi{\'n}ski Games}
\label{sec:jurdgame}

Jurdzi{\'n}ski has defined a family of games on which the small progress measures algorithm
exhibits an exponential running time \cite{Jurdzinski/00}. The Jurdzi{\'n}ski game $J_{d,w}$ of depth 
$d$ and width $w$ forms a rectangle of dimension $(2d+1) \times (2w)$. For instance, $J_{50,100}$
is generated by calling
\begin{verbatim}
    ~/pgsolver> bin/jurdzinskigame 50 100
\end{verbatim}


% \begin{figure}[t]
% \begin{center}
% \scalebox{0.6}{\input{graphics/marcingame.eepic}}
% \end{center}

% \caption{The Jurdzi{\'n}ski games.}

\section{Recursive Ladder Games}

%\include{pgfgraphics}

% \begin{figure}[t]
% \begin{center}
% \pictrecursiveladder
% \end{center}
% \caption{The recursive ladder game of index 4.}
% \label{fig:recursiveladder}
% \end{figure}

The recursive ladder games form a family on which the recursive algorithm exhibits an exponential
running time.  The recursive ladder game of index $n$ has size $5 \cdot n$. 
% We omit a formal
% definition here. The construction can easily be inferred from Fig.~\ref{fig:recursiveladder}. Inside
% the nodes it shows the node's identifier (left of the colon) and its priority.
The recursive ladder game of index 4 results in 20 nodes and is generated by calling
\begin{verbatim}
    ~/pgsolver> bin/recursiveladder 4
\end{verbatim}





\section{Exponential Strategy Improvement Games}

The exponential strategy improvement games form a family on which both strategy improvement algorithms
exhibit an exponential running time (in the index of the game) \cite{FriedmannSI09}.
The exponential strategy improvement game of index $n$ has size $14 \cdot n + 11$. 
% We omit a formal definition here. The game of index 2 is depicted in Fig.~\ref{fig:expstratimpr}.
% Inside the nodes it
%shows the node's identifier (left of the colon) and its priority.
A game of index 4 results in 67 nodes and is generated by calling
\begin{verbatim}
    ~/pgsolver> bin/expstratimpr 4
\end{verbatim}

In order to verify that the strategy iteration indeed requires exponential runtime on these games, you
need to either disable all generic optimisations or transform the game using the \texttt{transformer}
tool with the parameters \texttt{-ss -ap -bn}.

\section{Model Checker Ladder Games}

The model checker ladder games form a family on which the model checker algorithm exhibits an
exponential running time.  The model checker ladder game of index $n$ has size $4 \cdot n$. 
% We omit a formal definition here. The construction can easily be inferred from
% Fig.~\ref{fig:modelcheckerladder}.
%Inside the nodes it shows the node's identifier (left of the colon) and its priority.
A model checker ladder game of index 3 results in 12 nodes and is generated by calling
\begin{verbatim}
    ~/pgsolver> bin/modelcheckerladder 3
\end{verbatim}

% \begin{figure}[h]

\section{Tower of Hanoi}

The Towers of Hanoi problem can be seen as a reachability game in the graph of game configurations.
The problem of size $n$ has $n$ disks that are to be moved from the first to the third rod.
A problem of size $3$ is generated by calling
\begin{verbatim}
    ~/pgsolver> bin/towersofhanoi 3
\end{verbatim}


\section{Fairness Verification of an Elevator System}

We encode a simple fairness verification problem as a parity game. States of a transition system modelling
an \emph{elevator} for $n$ floors are of type
$\{1,\ldots,n\} \times \{\mathtt{o},\mathtt{c}\} \times (\bigcup \{ \mathit{Perm}(S) \mid S \subseteq \{1,\ldots,n\})$.
The first component describes the current position of the elevator as one of the floors. The
second component indicates whether the door is \emph{open} or \emph{closed}. The third component -- a permutation
of a subset of all available floors -- holds the \emph{requests}, i.e.\ those floors that should be served next.
The transitions on these are as follows.
\begin{itemize}
\item At any moment, any request or none can be issued. For simplicity reasons, we assume that at most one floor
      is added to the requests per transition. Note that nondeterministically, no request can be issued, and a
      request for a certain floor that is already contained in the current requests does not change them.
\item If the door is open then it is closed in the next step, the current floor does not change.
\item If it is closed, the elevator moves one floor (up or down) into the direction of the first request. If the
      floor reached that way is among the requested ones, the door is opened and that floor is removed from the
      current requests. Otherwise, the door remains closed.
\end{itemize}
We consider two different implementations of this elevator model: the first one stores requests in FIFO
style, the second in LIFO style. The games $G_n$ (with FIFO), resp.\ $G'_n$ (with LIFO) result from
encoding the model checking problem for this transition system and the CTL$^*$ formula
$\mathtt{A}(\mathtt{GF}\mathit{isPressed} \to \mathtt{GF}\mathit{isAt})$ as a parity game
\cite{Stirling95}.  Proposition $\mathit{isPressed}$ holds in any state s.t.\ the request list contains
the number $n$, and $\mathit{isAt}$ holds in a state where the current floor is $n$. Hence, this
formula requires all runs of the elevator to satisfy the following fairness property: if the top floor
is requested infinitely often then it is being served infinitely often. It can easily be formulated in
the modal $\mu$-calculus using a formula of size $11$ and alternation depth $2$ (of type
$\nu$--$\mu$--$\nu$). Hence the resulting parity games have constant index 3.  Note that $G_n$
encodes a positive instance of the model checking problem whereas $G'_n$ encodes a negative one.
The game $G_4$ is generated by calling
\begin{verbatim}
    ~/pgsolver> bin/elevatorverification 4
\end{verbatim}
and the game $G'_5$ by calling
\begin{verbatim}
    ~/pgsolver> bin/elevatorverification -u 5
\end{verbatim}
